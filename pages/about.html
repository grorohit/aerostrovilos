        <h1>About Us</h1>
         <p>Aerostrovilos is an IITM based startup company aiming at manufacturing micro gas turbines for power-based application. We believe that micro gasturbines will be a revolutionizing technology in upcoming years as a portable power source for off grid applications. A few foreign companies have developed the technology in last one decade. We want to build this technology in India to further help the cause of PMâ€™s Make in India campaign.</p>
         <!--<p class="lead">Currently in India, most of the engines used for remote and low power (up to 1-2 MW) generation are piston engines. Piston gas engines have their own problem of frequent servicing causing halts, high pollution exhaust, and huge operational cost. This leads to huge losses for the owner. As we go back in the 1960s, these were the most important reasons that in aircraft propulsion, they were replaced by gas turbines. Gas turbine is a well established but an intricate technology requiring high-quality technology for manufacturing and designing. A micro turbine that we want to develop can have application in the following fields.</p>
         <p class="lead">Firstly, we believe that these engines can be used to generate electricity using biogas, landfill or producer gas more efficiently and economically than the current technology. Although the piston engine technology is mature, we do have huge operational cost requirement for their smooth running. The smaller capacity engines (below 250kW) are diesel converted, with poor performance and I have found many examples where they have miserably failed. Even bigger engines require regular servicing, which is quite cost-intensive. I have felt this is the reason why many people are not going with biogas power generation, worsening the engine aspect; the digester itself costs a lot. </p>
         <p class="lead">Secondly, they could be used like direct plug in application for electricity generation using natural gas, LPG and or diesel. Industries that require separate high power and can't rely on grid, can use this. Oil extraction sites can use onsite natural gas to run these to cater their power demands. Marine ships that require power for their onboard application are mostly using diesel or gas engines, although Capstone has installed one microturbine using natural gas. I think the waste generated by people on ship overtime can be used to run biogas generators; otherwise, natural gas engines can always be used.</p>
         <p class="lead">Thirdly, we can find all the cogen application and these engines can be installed over there no matter what fuel is to be used. One such example would be Desalination and water treatment plant. Electricity can be used to run RO plant, and heat from exhaust can be used to run thermal desalination plant. The combustion exhaust can be used to run a desalination plant.</p>
         <p class="lead">Fourthly,  Electrical Vehicles are considered to be the future of automotive industry. One of the startups from our college, Ather Energy is making electrical scooters. Micro gasturbines can be used in Electrical vehicles to charge the batteries to provide 8-10 times of the current distance range. Therefore, vehicles will require lesser batteries that contribute towards 60% of its cost. Jaguar has already employed this technology in one of their supercars.</p>  
         <p class="lead">The first three applications can be considered as the immediate markets and the last one can be considered as near future or upcoming market in next 4-5 years. Our current focus is on building a 100kW gas generator.</p>!-->
